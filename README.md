## Logistic regression to predict the customer behaviour for clicking on the advertisement

#### About the project:
This is the advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a Logistic Regression model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

#### Analyzing the data:
This data set contains the following features:

* 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
* 'Age': cutomer age in years
* 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
* 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
* 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
* 'City': City of consumer
* 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
* 'Country': Country of consumer
* 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
* 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad

#### Activation Function used:
The Sigmoid or the Logistic function has been used as an activation function in this model

#### Accuracy of the model:
The Model thus developed is 90% accurate in predicting whether the user has clicked on the advertisement or not based on the browsing behaviour of the user.
